The Original SnowG
In 2004, I sold everything I owned and moved to Colorado. I joined Winter Park Resorts Lift Operations team
and chose to utilize their employee housing offerings as my place of residence. I was randomly placed with
3 other roommates. One of them was this crazy kid my age name Alika from Colorado Springs. After over a decade
of adventures in December of 2018 I joined the team for his brand SnowG Streetwear as their web development
and digital marketing specialist.

The application is a mobile focused synopsis of SnowG as a brand
utilizing HTML/CSS/Firebase to better provide traffic to our retail
site and social media platforms.

Moving into 2019 we plan to expand the brand's product offerings and 
social media platform presence. As for our website we are currently 
moving from HTML/CSS to a React/ReactNative version as well as incorporate
our own store and payment systems to better serve our growing customer base.
